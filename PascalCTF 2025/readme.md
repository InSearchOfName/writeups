# PascalCTF 2025
These are some of the challenges i solved during pascalCTF altought there are not alot of them this is cause this is my second CTF ever and the first one i have documented + this ctf was only 4 hours long and i needed to start an hour later cause of reasons altough i enjoyed it

Altough this CTF was SOLO playing as teams was allowed so i worked toghether with [Mathijs De Wilde](https://github.com/MathijsDeWilde) and with [Chomken](https://github.com/chomken)
